#Find where to go with WHERE-TO
Where-To is an application aimed at helping Chicagoans find free events around their city. Its main focus is to present event data in an easy to read design, thereby creating a better user experience. Where-To accomplishes a minimalistic approach by displaying events one at a time on the page(scrolling down the page or through a simple slide show). In addition to the design are other features which allow for fun experiences to not be missed out on, such as allowing the user to save their chosen events.
